    (one line per file to describe all the files in the project).  This ancient

  * From: Scott Finneran <scott@fozzie>
  * Date: Wed Jun 13 23:06:36 2007
  * This change adds a variable for specifying the granularity of the file
    timestamps. Most FSs will support a value of 1. Cygwin supports 1 on NTFS
    and 2 on FAT and unfortunately doesn't provide an easy way to determine the
    FS type.
  * Rather than default to the worst case of 2 (the situation previously), a
    user can now specify the value in seconds with a built-in cook variable. The
    default under cygwin is now 1.
  * I assign copyright of any code contained within to Peter Miller without
    reservation.

cook (2.23.D002-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * I've been having problems for a while now with parallel builds using cook.
    It turns out that hitting this bug in cook probably required an unusual set
    of conditions:
  * 1) Running as: cook -par 8
  * 2) Running on an SMP system (may not matter).
  * 3) A very fast recipe; body follows:
  * echo \"#!/home/jasone/cw/devroot/bin/onyx/bin/tonyx\" > [target]
  * && cat ./%0test/%.nx.in >> [target]
  * && chmod u+x [target];
  * 4) Many files generated by the fast recipe (currently in excess of 800).
  * The problem is in common/itab.c:split(). That function doubles the size of a
    hash table, then rebuilds the table. The problem is, it doesn't bother to
    switch to the new table once it has been constructed. Thus, for any bucket
    chains that have collisions at the original size, elements other than the
    first ones are no longer accessible.  Naturally, this bug is a huge memory
    leak, even if we get lucky and there are no collisions, since split() is
    repeatedly called, but the table never gets larger to relieve the pressure.
  * My thanks to Jason Evans for this patch.

cook (2.19.D007-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This change is another attempt to get fingerprint behavior right in the face
    of all the horrible things ClearCase does to file time stamps.
  * My thanks to Christian Goetze for reporting this problem.

 -- Peter Miller <pmiller@opensource.org.au>  Thu, 23 May 2002 09:46:02 +1000

cook (2.19.D006-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This change improves they way fingerprints are managed. An additional field
    has been added to accurately track the actual st_mtime of the file, rather
    than assuming that it *will* be "newest". This should give much better
    behaviour when the file mod time moves into the past.

cook (2.19.D005-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This change fixes a problem introduced with recent versions of bison.  It
    adds multiplke include insulation to the generated .h file (which is good)
    bu they uses a Y symbol instead of a YY symbol (so the automatic symbol
    renaming didn't work).

cook (2.17.D008-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This change tides up some of the work done to fix the ingredients-
    fingerprint problem.  In particular, it regularises the quite handler usage,
    to take out the ugly hack imposed upon cook/main.c, and preplaces it with
    the idea of a "priority" quit handler, to be run first.

 -- Peter Miller <pmiller@opensource.org.au>  Thu, 12 Jul 2001 10:13:12 +1000

cook (2.17.D007-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * My thanks to Jerry Pendergraft <jerry@endocardial.com> for this
    contribution.

cook (2.16.D007-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This change adds edge types.  Edge types are the ability to attribute graph
    edges with type information.  The implicit type being "istrictly younger
    than" or "(strict)".  Two more edge types have been added: "(weak)" meaning
    <= time, useful for symlinks and hard links; and "(exist)" requiring mere
    existence, useful for some types of version files.

cook (2.15.D006-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This change fixed a bug which only manifested when fingerprints *and* the -
    reason option were being used, and even then only sometimes.
  * My thanks to Adam Schlegel <aceschle@thinkage.ca> for sending this patch.

 -- Peter Miller <pmiller@opensource.org.au>  Tue, 24 Oct 2000 17:48:56 +1100

cook (2.11.D013-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This change fixed a bug where Cook could sometimes wait for a process and
    then forget its exit status. Then the graph walker would wait forever for
    the already terminated process to terminate.  (In particular, this happened
    when you used [execute] in a recipe body.)
  * My thanks to Kirill A. Kornilov <kirill.kornilov@trustworks.com> for
    reporting this problem.

cook (2.11.D010-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This change removed the "if SGI" conditionals from around the "if directory
    already exists, do nothing" code in the os_mkdir function.	This means this
    test is *always* performed.	 It turns out that the Solaris automounter
    always returns ENOSYS for all names in the top-level directory of an
    indirect map - i.e. it doesn't test for existence first (amd does the right
    thing, fortunately).
  * My thanks to Greg Steuck <greg@nexprise.com> for reporting this problem.

cook (2.11.D007-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This change fixed a bug in the double colon rules processing, which caused
    the second and subsequent recipes to (aparrently) not activate.  In fact,
    cook sometime erroneously concluded the target was up-to-date, creating the
    appearance of not building the graph with those recipes included.
  * My thanks to  Peter Simons <simons@cys.de> for reporting this problem.

cook (2.11.D006-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This change relaxes the %0 pattern restrictions.  It need no longer appear
    only at the start of a string or after a slash.  This will not break any
    existing cookbooks, but is does mean that some errors will no longer be
    reported.  This change is being made to bring Cook in line with the
    expectations of the majority of users.

 -- Peter Miller <pmiller@opensource.org.au>  Fri, 12 Nov 1999 12:32:44 +1100

cook (2.11.D004-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This change fixes a probelm when Cook is executed from a CGI script.  It
    seems that there are cases where there is no HOME environment variable set,
    causing Cook to exit with a fatal error.

cook (2.10.D010-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This change adds a --ignore option to cook_bom. This is useful for ignoring
    things link CVS directories.
  * I have a suggestion which may be worth implementing. We have our source code
    under CVS control and it's rather annoying that manifest is getting
    contaminated with CVS directories and their content. I couldn't think of an
    easy way to modify the recipe not to include CVS directories, so I patched
    cook_bom to ignore CVS directories on it's own. Now, I did it in a quick and
    hacky way: just patched ignore() in sniff.c to ignore CVS as well as . and
    '..'. But it may be worth doing to add command line options to cook_bom to
    make it ignore certain directories/files. Or maybe it can be achived easily
    with a correct recipe?
  * My thanks to Gregory Steuck <steuck@iname.com> for this suggestion.

cook (2.10.D008-1) unstable; urgency=low

    add this feature.

cook (2.9.D018-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This change improves the behaviour of the fingerprint code, to reduce the
    number of re-calculation instances substantially.

 -- Peter Miller <pmiller@opensource.org.au>  Wed, 01 Sep 1999 11:15:48 +1000

cook (2.9.D017-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This improves the behaviour of the remote shell invocation to cope with more
    boundary conditions.  In particular, it copes with rshd at the remote end
    failing to span a shell, and it copes with the default shell at the remote
    end not being the Bourne shell.
  * My thanks to Jerry Pendergraf <jerry.pendergraf@endocardial.com> and Arnout
    Vandecappelle <vdcappel@imec.be> for these suggestions.

cook (2.9.D015-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This change fixes a bug where fingerprinting made evrything slower because
    it kept recalculating fingerprints over and over. The correct behaviour is
    for ./.cook.fp to be written out if either . or one of the unwritables has
    changed, but when it is written out, . and <i>all</i> of the unwritables get
    written (not just the dirty ones).

cook (2.9.D013-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This change improves Cook's parallel behaviour. Previously Cook was looking
    for more parallel jobs to do before it was waiting for jobs completing. On
    systems with the wait3 system call (almost all moder Unix boxes) this has
    been improved to look for exiting jobs first.

 -- Peter Miller <pmiller@opensource.org.au>  Thu, 19 Aug 1999 16:31:40 +1000

cook (2.9.D012-1) unstable; urgency=low

cook (2.9.D011-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This change copes with the case (common with ClearCase) where the mtime of a

  * My thanks to Cristian Goetze <cg@resolute.com> for this suggestion.

 -- Peter Miller <pmiller@opensource.org.au>  Thu, 12 Aug 1999 12:28:28 +1000

cook (2.9.D010-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This change adds a new builtin function, [mtime-seconds], which is like the
    existing [mtime] function, except that is returns seconds since the epoch,
    rather than a human-readable time.	This is more useful for doing arithmetic
    on.
  * My thanks to Gus <gus@getsystems.com> for this suggestion.

cook (2.9.D006-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This change makes it valid to use double colons when specifying ingredients
    recipes (recipes with no recipe body) when there is more than one target.
    Some users seem to find this an intuitive use of double colons.

  * This change relaxes some of the argument constraints for builtin functions.
    Most involve allowing zero arguments, rather thsan demanding at least one.

cook (2.5.D009-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This change brings together all of the common string accumulation activities
    through the api already in place in cook/lex.c.  But it was moved into

cook (2.5.D004-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This change makes Cook less optimistic when using fingerprints in
    combination with the search_list.  It would infreqently conclude that a
    shallow target was up-to-date when a shallow ingredient was editied to be
    the same as a deeper ingredient.

cook (2.4.D007-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This change updates all tests to use COOK_TMP (if set) to locate the
    temporary directory.  This allows testing away from /tmp - which causes

cook (2.3.D009-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This change renames the ``aux'' directory to be ``etc''.	     This is
    motivated by an attempt to port Cook to the CygWin32 system.   the problem
    is that the string ``aux'' anywhere in the path is interpreted to mean the
    "aux:" device.   The win32 API is typically brain-dead.

cook (2.3.D007-1) unstable; urgency=low
